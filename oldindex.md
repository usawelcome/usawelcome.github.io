Here are some helpful, quick tips on recent developments in US immigration (Jan 27, 2017).

This is not legal advice!  If you can, get a lawyer.

Top Tips are:

* Do not sign any papers that you do not understand.
* Be aware that US courts now say that you cannot be immediately deported after you arrive in the USA.  ([Here][page] is the relevant page of the court order.)
* The entry process may feel scary and uncertain.  Try to be calm and patient.
