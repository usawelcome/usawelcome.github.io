### Boston Airport: Status & Details

  * Persons on **direct** flights to Boston Logan Airport should be allowed to
    board flights and should be admitted on arrival if they have a valid, current visa or
    lawful permanent resident status, until Saturday, February 4, 2017.
  * Even if you were previously denied boarding, you should be able to travel on a new flight before Feb. 4 but it must be a **direct** flight to Boston Logan Airport. 
  * **Direct** means no layovers or connections either before or after Boston. If there is

    a city that has a direct flight to Boston.
  * The Courtâ€™s ruling stopping the Executive Order will last until February 4, 2017.
