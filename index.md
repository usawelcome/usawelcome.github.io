Here are some helpful, quick tips on recent developments in US immigration (Jan 27, 2017).  This is not legal advice!  If you can, get a lawyer.

Top Tips are:
  * Do not sign any papers that you do not understand.
  * Be aware that US courts now say that you cannot be immediately deported after you arrive in the USA.  ([Here](https://github.com/usawelcome/usawelcome.github.io/blob/master/orderPage2.png) is the relevant page of the court order.)
  * The entry process may feel scary and uncertain.  Try to be calm and patient.
